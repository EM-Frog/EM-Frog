-Hi there! 👋
My name is Eric.

About Me
🔭 I’m currently working on improving my backpack camping skills by exploring new trails and learning more about wilderness.
🎣 I'm also an avid fisherman and enjoy exploring new bodies of water to catch a variety of fish species.
🖨️ When I'm not outdoors, I love tinkering with my 3D printer and creating unique and useful items for myself and others.
🌿 Additionally, I have a passion for vivarium-making and creating natural habitats for various reptiles and amphibians.
📷 Finally, I love photography and capturing the beauty of nature, landscapes, and wildlife.
Collaboration
I'm always looking for like-minded individuals to collaborate with on outdoor or creative projects. If you're interested in teaming up or have an idea in mind, please don't hesitate to reach out!
